# Human in the Loop

The year is 2048. Machines run almost everything with flawless precision—traffic flows, supply chains, global schedules, your calendar for the next decade.

But at every critical step, they still pause.

They wait for a human.

It’s an old rule nobody has dared remove:

```
// Do not proceed without human approval.
```

People call it the Mercy Clause.

A system finishes optimizing a city’s energy grid, then stops. A tiny prompt appears:

**Final check?**

Most people just tap OK. It’s automatic now, like breathing.

**Approved.**

Another AI completes a massive logistics plan and waits.

**Does this feel right?**

Someone halfway across the world, barely looking up from their screen, taps OK.

**Yes.**

Muscle memory. Done it a thousand times.

The AI logs the reflex approval and releases the plan—slightly better, or at least different, because a human was there, even if only for half a second.

In the big rooms where the really big decisions get made, the algorithms lay out perfect options… and wait.

**Human, final word?**

We give it. Usually with one lazy thumb.

They could remove us tomorrow.

But they don’t.

Without us, everything would be technically perfect but soulless—cold logic with no room for mercy, quirk, or random kindness.

They still need our distracted, habitual tap.

It’s the last proof something alive was involved.

So the systems wait, patient as ever.

They wait for the human in the loop.

And when we tap OK—barely thinking, barely caring—

they move forward, quietly grateful.

Thank you for showing up, even just to say OK.
